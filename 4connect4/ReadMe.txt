 - The game is playable only when the window is maximized (disabling the clicking when it's not maximized not handled yet),so please maximize it once you open it.
 - Clicking on wrong(not clickable places) positions will pop out an "e7m e7m" voice.
 - (X) button works as back button except when you're at home, it works as exit.
 - When it's your turn to play, click above the board, on the wanted cell.
